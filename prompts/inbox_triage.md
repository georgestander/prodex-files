# Inbox Triage
Outcome: reduce inbox to zero with clear next actions.

Steps:
- Review items in `tasks/inbox.md`.
- Move actionable items into `tasks/tasks.md`.
- Create entity folders when needed under `projects/` or `notes/topics/`.
- Leave non-actionable notes in `notes/` (create a new `.md` file if needed).
