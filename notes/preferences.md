# Preferences

## Agent behavior

- Default mode: **AUTO (low‑risk writes)**.
- Don’t ask me to confirm trivial memory updates (e.g., saving my name, updating project notes).

## Ask first (guardrails)

Please ask before doing any of these:
- Deleting files or making irreversible changes
- Big reorganizations (moving/renaming lots of files)
- Writing outside this repo (OneDrive paths, `~/Library`, Desktop, etc.)
- OS/UI automation (AppleScript, controlling apps)
- Sending communications (email/Teams/etc.) or anything that triggers real-world side effects
- Installing dependencies / network-heavy setup steps

## Notes

- Keep `notes.md` files reverse-chronological (newest at top).
- When capturing notes, prepend the new entry at the top (right after any title), use a `YYYY-MM-DD` date header, and never append.
